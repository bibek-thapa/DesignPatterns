/*
 * Open Closed Principle:
 * 
 * Class and method should be open for the extension but closed for the modification
 *
 * When everytime the user requests to put the new features, we should extend the 
 * class in such a way that we can fulfill the user's request by extending the class
 * but modifying the class should be big noo.
 * 
 * The way I am making everything in same file is because I have never written code
 * in such a way and I want to see how it goes. I would always prefer to make the 
 * separate classes and enum classes
